# Wordle

Basic Wordle game implemented in c.
Had no internet for 24h so i challenged my self to see if i could write create something without looking up
anything

## Things that can improve

 * Handle Memory Properly 
 * Structure code better

* Introduce ncurses to display words 
    - Maybe right TUI library?? that could be fun

* Could even have a GUI version (using raylib) 

* Introduce Streaks

* sync TUI and GUI
